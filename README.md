# Construction of CPI Index Based on Attention Degree

## Introduction

This is the final project of Financial Economic Big Data Mining in the fall semester of 17-18 school year. 
It is a simple attempt to use machine learning method and neural network in Economics. We use some traditional machine learning method and a simple neural network to do the construction of CPI index. Gladly we get a not bad result.

Naive_Machine_Leanring_Method.py consists of some machine learning methods.

data_util.py is some of my code for Data preprocessing. Unfortunately some of my codes are lost.

nn.py is my simple neural network.

月度数据.xls is the target data.

基于关注度的CPI指数构建.pdf is my report for the project. Because of my teacher's request, it is written in Chinese.

dat.xlsx is the data I crawled from Baidu Index website.
